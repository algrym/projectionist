Service to interface a BENQ TK850 projector to Home Assistant via MQTT

I won't update this any more: I no longer own this projector.

I've got lots more to document here.  There are doc links, captures, and
example configurations available in the repo.

One note: when using a systemd user service, be sure to `loginctl enable-linger`
or you'll have woes.
